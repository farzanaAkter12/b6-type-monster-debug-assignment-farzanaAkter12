            <div class="question"><h2>What are the differeces between Global Scope and Blog Scope?</h2></div>
            <div class="answer">
                <h3>Global Scope</h3>
               <p>
      The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope.
      Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state
       can access that variable.</p>
<h3>Block Scope</h3>
<p>
Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the
curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only
allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

            <div class="question"><h2>What is Javascript Event Loop?</h2></div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    A programming structure that continually tests for external events and calls the appropriate routines to handle them. An
                    event loop is often the main loop in a program that typically waits for the user to trigger something.
                </p>
                <p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and
                processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.</p>
